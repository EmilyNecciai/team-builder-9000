  ## Project Description
This application, the Team Builder 9000, allows HR professionals or managers to log information about their team via terminal/command line and then form an html page that delivers that information in a clean way. 

> Module 10 Challenge - an employee logging system that executes from the command line. 


### Demo 
[Go to Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GxgmyvCz0mGX910WDPOW9f3yLvNiBoUX/view?usp=sharing) (Use `Ctrl + Click` to open the video in a new tab.)

This demo first shows that the tests work `npm run tests`, then the walkthrough of how to enter information into the command line. Finally, it shows you the output of the information, as well as what the links look like when clicked through. 

You can see a sample HTML file in the ./dist folder. It's titled `sample-index.html`.
